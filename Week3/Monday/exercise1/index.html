    <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h2>
    <h5>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
    <h6>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

    <!-- Part 3 -->
    <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm going to put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items <ul><li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li></ul></li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
        <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
        <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
